# PyTorch implementations of deep learning models

This repository contains jupyter notebooks implementing several deep learning models using PyTorch. Each notebook contains detailed explanations about each model, hopefully making it easy to understand all steps.

The notebooks run in Python 3.6 and the newest PyTorch version (currently 0.4.0)

Models:
- [Convolutional Neural Network](CNN_MNIST.ipynb)
